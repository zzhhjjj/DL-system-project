Is there any experience on Earth that even compares slightly to having been on the Moon?", "output": "My first words of my impression of being on the surface of the Moon that just came to my mind was \"magnificent desolation.\" The magnificence of human beings, humanity, Planet Earth, maturing the technologies, imagination and courage to expand our capabilities beyond the next ocean, to dream about being on the Moon, and then taking advantage of increases in technology and carrying out that dream - achieving that is magnificent testimony to humanity. But it is also desolate - there is no place on earth as desolate as what I was viewing in those first moments on the Lunar Surface.\n\nBecause I realized what I was looking at, towards the horizon and in every direction, had not changed in hundreds, thousands of years. Beyond me I could see the moon curving away - no atmosphere, black sky. Cold. Colder than anyone could experience on Earth when the sun is up- but when the sun is up for 14 days, it gets very, very hot. No sign of life whatsoever.\n\nThat is desolate. More desolate than any place on Earth."}

{"input": "How to help end homelessness?", "output": "Homelessness can feel like a daunting problem, especially as the population grows and living costs continue to rise. Helping to end homelessness will ensure no one has to go without a permanent, stable place to live. Give back to homeless organizations and participate in events that focus on ending homelessness. Advocating for changes to policies and laws around homelessness and treating homeless people with respect can also help to address this important issue.\n\n## Support homeless organizations and group\n\n1. Volunteer your time to a local homeless shelter. Start small by volunteering weekly or monthly at a homeless shelter in your area. Sign up to volunteer to serve food to the homeless or to create care packages for the homeless. You may challenge yourself to volunteer for 2-4 hours a week or twice a month. Or you may devote time during the holidays to work at a homeless shelter. Enlist friends or family to volunteer with you at a homeless shelter.\n2. Donate your skills to a non-profit organization that focuses on homelessness. Search for non-profit groups and organizations that work on initiatives for ending homelessness in your area. Contact them and offer to help them in any way you can. Put skills you already have to good use by donating them to the organization. For example, if you have coding skills, you may offer to update the organization\u2019s website. Or if you love talking to people, you may offer to work in a call center or go door to door to promote the non-profit organization.\n3. Give monetary donations to homeless groups and organizations. Donating money to homeless organizations can go a long way to helping with this issue. You may give a large sum once a year to a specific program for the homeless or to the organization as whole. Regular giving, where you give a small amount once weekly or once a month, can also help. Donate to a homeless organization as a gift for a friend or in memory of someone close to you. Make a holiday donation to the organization as a way to give back. Raise money for these organizations by setting up a fundraiser online for them or by asking others for donations.\n4. Go to fundraisers for homeless organizations. Show your support for ending homelessness by attending fundraisers and events that address the issue. Check your local community board for events to raise funds for a local homeless shelter or drop in center. Find out if there are fundraisers in your area that you can donate time or money to. Donate an item for a silent auction at an event for the homeless. Bid on items to help raise money for the issue. Invite friends and family to fundraisers to benefit the homeless so they can participate as well.\n5. Participate in food and clothing drives for the homeless. Donate clothing or food for the drive. Volunteer to collect food and clothing for the drive. Promote the food and clothing drive on social media to get others to donate. Warm coats, socks, scarves, and hats are all good options for a clothing drive. Non-perishable food like canned goods, crackers, and granola bars are ideal donations for a food drive. Most communities will run annual food and clothing drives, especially around Christmas time when the weather is cold and homeless people need more support. Check your community board or at your community center for information on upcoming food or clothing drives. Your school or your church may also run a food and clothing drive for the homeless.\n\n\n## Advocate for homeless policies and laws\n\n1. Write or call your government representative about ending homelessness. Many long term solutions for homelessness require changes to existing policies and laws. Contact your representative in government and ask them what they are doing to help end homelessness. Remind them that homelessness is an important issue that their constituents care about and want to address. Search online for contact information for your government representative. Calling them directly will be more effective than writing a letter. Messaging them publicly on social media can also be effective. For example, you may write to your mayor or you may contact your senator. You can also reach out to city council members to find out how they plan to address the issue. In your letter or call, advocate for more investment in affordable housing and social services to help prevent homelessness. Discuss the need for services that help homeless people find permanent homes and stay off the street. Note the need for counseling and rehabilitation centers for homeless people with addiction issues so they can get better and find employment.\n2. Support political candidates that care about ending homelessness. Put your right to vote to work by only supporting candidates who discuss ending homelessness in their platforms and during their campaigns. Promote them on social media and volunteer for their campaign. Cast your vote for them on election day. Tell friends and family about political candidates who discuss ending homelessness so they can stay informed and vote.\n3. Organize a march or protest that focuses on support for the homeless. Let others know about this important issue by organizing a march or a peaceful protest that focuses on ending homelessness. Invite friends, family members, and colleagues to the march. Promote the march or protest on social media so others can participate. Make signs that note the importance of ending homelessness and bring them to the march. Use a megaphone at the protest to give speeches about the issue. Have the march or protest in a public space, such as in front of a government building or in a public square.\n4. Work towards a career as a politician, lobbyist, or non-profit worker. Do well in your social studies and history classes in high school. Join a school debate team or public speaking club to get better at these skills. Take classes in political science, history, and conflict resolution in university. Get involved in local politics and non-profit organizations. Apply to positions as a lobbyist or a non-profit worker so you can work to actively end homelessness on a day to day basis. Run for local office with a platform that focuses on ending homelessness in your community.\n\n\n## Treat homeless people with respect\n\n1. Acknowledge the homeless person with a smile or nod. Rather than rushing by them without looking at them, make eye contact and smile or nod at them. Let them know that you see them and acknowledge them as a person. This is a small way for you to show empathy for them. Avoid yelling, shouting, or mocking the homeless person, as this will only make them feel more alienated and alone. Treat them like a friend or family member, showing care and respect for them.\n2. Try starting a conversation with the homeless person. Ask them how they are doing. Find out where they are from. Keep the conversation open and friendly. Maintain eye contact when you talk to them so they know you care. For example, you may say, \u201cHow are you today?\u201d or \u201cWhere are you from originally?\u201d\n\t* If the homeless person does not seem interested in answering your questions, don\u2019t pressure them into answering. Let them decide if they want to engage with you on a deeper level.\n3. Offer to buy the homeless person a meal. If you have the time and funds, offer to grab the person a cup of coffee or a sandwich from somewhere nearby. Getting the person a warm meal may make their day and help them feel less down about their situation. The meal does not have to be elaborate or expensive. A cup of coffee or a small snack would likely be appreciated by the person.\n4. Give the homeless person a care package. Prepare a care package that contains important items like socks, warm gloves, toothpaste, lip balm, and non-perishable food like crackers or nuts. Give out the care packages to homeless people in your area so they have supplies that they need. Make it a habit to hand out care packages to homeless people once a month or regularly during the winter months.\n5. Decide to give the person money if you feel comfortable. Giving money to a homeless person is a personal preference and completely up to you. Handing change or a few bucks to a homeless person can be a demonstration of empathy and help them in a very direct way. You may decide to give the person a meal, rather than money. Or you may sometimes give the person money and offer them food other times.\n"}
{"input": "What are some strategies to maintain morale and productivity after massive layoffs? I am not in a managerial role, just a lead role, and am asking for myself and my fellow employees.", "output": "The situation you're describing is tough. Layoffs have a very real impact on both the individuals that are let go and those that remain. I'm sorry you're experiencing this.\nHere are some things to consider that may help you and your colleagues cope with the added stress and emotions following a layoff:\n\n* Acknowledge the layoff and the feelings of your colleagues. Avoiding the topic can extend negative feelings and disenfranchise those most impacted. You should find an opportunity to connect with your colleagues for an honest conversation about your feelings following the layoff.  Perhaps reach out to hold a number of 1-on-1 conversations, or gather your team for an off-site lunch and prompt the discussion.\n* Acknowledge that everyone will be impacted differently. Some of your colleagues will feel totally okay and ready to get back to work.  Others will feel anxious and worried in a way that prevents them from performing the same way they did before the layoff.  There is no right or \"professional\" reaction to a layoff.  Be open to the feelings and reactions of all of your colleagues equally.\n* Create practical solutions to new processes and responsibilities. If your team now has a greater workload, be a generator of solutions.  Try out ideas for making processes in your team more efficient and predictable.\n* Create transparency about the state of the business and potential future staff changes. Layoffs are a clear indication of business trouble.  Facilitate sharing facts about the state of the business and actively work to eliminate rumors.  Additionally, layoffs will likely cause shifts in responsibility as roles are consolidated or reorganized.  Make clear who has specific responsibilities both inside and outside of your team.  Actively eliminate any sources of uncertainty and anxiety that you can.\n* Be a role model. Don't participate in gossip or complaining about the layoff.  Don't disparage management or other colleagues in casual conversation.  Be a model for professionalism and caring.\n* Maintain work standards and a caring meritocracy. A layoff isn't an excuse for allowing work quality to decline.  Additionally, differences in productivity and quality between team members should be consistently and fairly addressed.  If a team member is underperforming following the layoff, provide direct feedback and ask what you can do to help.\n"}
{"input": "Given that Kohn-Sham DFT is strictly a ground-state method (at 0 K), how is it sufficient to describe materials in real-life applications?", "output": "These are a few extra points to complement Andrew Rosen's comprehensive response:\n\n* To be absolutely clear, typical DFT calculations are not performed at 0K, a better description of what happens is that they are performed \"for a static crystal\". Static crystal means that the atoms are fixed at their crystallographic positions (which is what a typical DFT calculation does), but this situation is different from 0K. Even at 0K, the atomic nuclei move due to quantum zero-point motion (also called quantum fluctuations). This quantum zero-point motion is very small for compounds containing heavy elements, which means that in these cases \"0K\" and \"static crystal\" are almost the same and many people use the terms interchangeably. However, quantum zero-point motion can be very large for light elements, for example in solid hydrogen (the lightest of all compounds) it dominates even at room temperature. To perform a calculation at 0K (as opposed to a static crystal calculation), the strategy that Andrew Rosen proposed would still work if you use quantum statistics. For example, solving the vibrational problem within the harmonic approximation at the quantum mechanical level with give you the zero-point energy as the ground state of a quantum harmonic oscillator. A good reference for hydrogen is this review article.\n* Although Andrew Rosen is correct in that the potential energy surface is largely temperature independent, there are a few situations in which the potential energy surface does vary significantly with temperature. An example of this is provided by many perovskite crystals (e.g. $\\ce{BaTiO_3}$), which undergo a series of temperature-induced structural phase transitions. For example, at very high temperatures the structure is cubic, and this structure sits at a minimum of the potential free energy surface. However, if you calculated the potential energy surface (instead of the free energy surface), then it has a double-well shape and the cubic structure is at the saddle point, so the structure will lower its energy by distorting and going to one of the minima. This is precisely what happens at low temperatures because the corresponding free energy surface acquires a double-well shape, and the system undergoes a structural phase transition. A good early DFT reference for this is this paper.\n* As already pointed out by others, the differences between DFT and TDDFT or $GW$-BSE are not related to the inclusion or exclusion of temperature. In this language, both TDDFT and $GW$-BSE have no temperature for the behaviour of the nuclei, and you could incoporate it in a similar fashion to what Andrew Rosen described for DFT.\n"}
{"input": "If we fold a paper and then apply pressure on the newly formed crease, it seems that the paper's surface gets a permanent deformation but what exactly has happened to the paper at a molecular scale?", "output": "Basically, a fold or crease in paper will remain because the structure of the fibers in the paper have become irreversibly damaged. This happens because the paper is bent/compressed beyond its elastic limit.\n\nChemically, paper is mainly composed of cellulose  from plant fibers. Cellulose is an organic polymer, which has D-glucose units connected through hydrogen bonds. These bonds form between the oxygen atom of the one-hydroxyl group belonging to the glucose and the hydrogen atom of the next glucose unit. These are microscopic properties of paper, but to understand what happens when we fold paper or do Origami, it is sufficient to learn what is happening macroscopically.\n\nAll materials have what is called an elastic limit and a plastic region. The elastic limit is the point at which a material will bend but still return to its original position without any permanent change or damage to its structure. Further deforming the material beyond this limit takes it to its plastic region. At this point any structural or physical changes become permanent and the paper will not return to its original form.\n\nEvery material has a different elastic limit or yield, and plastic region. Imagine holding a piece of paper slightly bent but not folding or creasing it. The plant fibers that make up the paper will not have exceeded their elastic limit. So as soon as you let go of the paper sheet it will quickly return to its noncreased original flat state. However, if you were to roll that piece of paper into a cylinder and hold it for a few minutes, some of these fibers will be pushed beyond the elastic limit which is evident since it will not lie flat anymore since slight deformations have occurred in this sheet.\n\nNow, when you properly fold a piece of paper as you would during Origami, the plant fibers along the crease are pushed into the plastic region of the paper, causing a fracture point at the actual line of the fold. A practical example of this is if you were to fold a piece of paper, you will note that if you stretch the paper evenly on both sides of the fold, the paper will tear right on the fold (a quick way to &quot;cut&quot; paper if you have no scissors). The fold then becomes an irreversible structural failure and the fibers in the paper will never regain their original state.\n\nBecause of this damage to its structure, the paper will from then on have this fold. And no matter how hard you try to flatten out the fold it will never return to its original state. This is why Origami models continually retain their shape."}
{"input": "Quantum state teleportation is the quantum information protocol where a qubit is transferred between two parties using an initial shared entangled state, Bell measurement, classical communication and local rotation. Apparently, there is also something called quantum gate teleportation.\nWhat is quantum gate teleportation and what is it used for?\nI am particularly interested in possible applications in simulating quantum circuits.", "output": "Quantum gate teleportation is the act of being able to apply a quantum gate on the unknown state while it is being teleported. This is one of the ways in which measurement-based computation can be described using graph states.\n\nUsually, teleportation works by having an unknown quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ held by Alice, and two qubits in the Bell state $|\\Psi\\rangle=(|00\\rangle+|11\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ shared between Alice and Bob. Alice performs a Bell state measurement, getting one of 4 possible answers and Bob holds on his qubit, depending on the measurement result of Alice, one of the 4 states $|\\psi\\rangle,X|\\psi\\rangle,Z|\\psi\\rangle,ZX|\\psi\\rangle.$ So, once Bob learns what result Alice got, he can compensate by applying the appropriate Paulis.\n\nLet $U$ be a 1-qubit unitary. Assume Alice and Bob share $(\\mathbb{I}\\otimes U)|\\Psi\\rangle$ instead of $|\\Psi\\rangle$. If they repeat the teleportation protocol, Bob now has one of $U|\\psi\\rangle,UX|\\psi\\rangle,UZ|\\psi\\rangle,UZX|\\psi\\rangle$, which we can rewrite as $U|\\psi\\rangle,(UXU^\\dagger)U|\\psi\\rangle,(UZU^\\dagger)U|\\psi\\rangle,(UZXU^\\dagger)U|\\psi\\rangle.$ The compensations that Bob has to make for a given measurement result are given by the bracketed terms. Often, these are no worse than the compensations you would have to make for normal teleportation (i.e. just the Pauli rotations). For example, if $U$ is the Hadamard rotation, then the corrections are just $(\\mathbb{I},Z,X,XZ)$ respectively. So, you can apply the Hadamard during teleportation just be changing the state that you teleport through (There is a strong connection here to the Choi-Jamio\u0142kowski isomorphism). You can do the same for Pauli gates, and the phase gate $\\sqrt{Z}=S$. Moreover, if you repeat this protocol to build up a more complicated computation, it is often sufficient to keep a record of what these corrections are, and to apply them later.\n\nEven if you don't only need the Pauli gates (as is the case for $T=\\sqrt{S}$), the compensations may be easier than implementing the gate directly. This is the basis of the construction of the fault-tolerant T gate.\n\nIn fact, you can do something similar to apply a controlled-NOT between a pair of qubits as well. This time, the state you need is $|\\Psi\\rangle_{A_1B_1}|\\Psi\\rangle_{A_1B_1}$, and a controlled-NOT applied between $B_1$ and $B_2$. This time, there are 16 possible compensating rotations, but all of them are just about how Pauli operations propagate through the action of a controlled-NOT and, again, that just gives Pauli operations out."}

{"input": "How to host a what not to wear party?", "output": "Many people love the TV show \"What Not to Wear\", so it would obviously make a great party idea for them! Here's a guide on how to make your What Not to Wear party one to remember!\n\n## Step\n\n1. You can do this party one of two ways: Make it just like the show, and invite one of your friends/family members that makes fashion faux-pas a little too often, then surprise them by saying they they're going to get a fashion makeover! This is a great idea for a surprise birthday party, because then all the guests could get the birthday person fashionable clothes or gift cards to cool stores. Tell all your guests to wear their most horrible outfits. Floor-length skirts, see-through shirts, unmatched colours and patterns, old lady dresses, nurse's shoes, and bad makeup. Also, tell them to bring their favourite/most fashionable outfits. This is a good theme for younger kids/teenagers because it gets the guests more involved. If you want, you can mix components of both parties.\n2. For both parties, assign your own family/friends to be the cast of \"What not to Wear\". If possible, get a man and a woman and assign them as the hosts (Clinton Kelly and Stacy London), then a woman to be the makeup artist (Carmine), and possibly even a man to be the hairstylist (Ted Gibson). However, it's not recommended to have your hairstylist actually cut anyone's hair. Instead, have them braid their hair, or curl, crimp, or straighten it.\n3. For both parties, decorate your house/party space just like the \"What not to Wear\" studio. Make sure to have a place for your guests to get their makeup done by your very own Carmine. Place pictures of fashionable outfits around your house as well.\n4. At the end of either party theme, eat cake/snacks, chat, dance, or do whatever you please now that everyone looks great, and you can go to bed knowing that you had a great party!\n\n\n## \"what not to wear\" replica theme\n\n1. When you send out invitations to your guests, tell them to send you pictures of your 'Fashion Faux-Pas Person' (the FF-PP) wearing their worst outfits.\n2. Once the party starts, sit your 'Fashion Faux-Pas Person' (FF-PP) down, and tell them that you've been secretly filming them for the past 2 weeks (or however long you want). Then show them the pictures that your friends/family sent in of them. Then tell them that they're going to get a huge makeover!\n3. Go through your FF-PP's outfits and 'throw them away' (You don't have to if you don't want to).\n4. Instead of going shopping for new outfits like they do on the show, open your guests' presents (if they've gotten the birthday person clothes and gift cards). That will be their new wardrobe.\n5. Give your FF-PP a makeover! Do their makeup, nails, and hair.\n6. Reveal your made-over FF-PP to your guests.\n\n\n## Worst-dressed to best-dressed theme\n\n1. Send out invitations with the 'What not to Wear' logo on them, as well as pictures of Clinton Kelly and Stacy London, the hosts of the show. You can also have pictures of horrible outfits and put big red 'X's over them.\n2. Once everyone has arrived at the party, award your 'Worst-dressed Person' with a prize (something fashion-related, such as a pair of cute earrings).\n3. Have a 'worst-dressed' photo shoot. This is a lot of fun.\n4. Have 'Stacy' and 'Clinton' critique everyone's outfits, just like on the show.\n5. Tell your guests to get dressed in their favourite/most fashionable outfits. If somebody forgets theirs, lend them one of your chic outfits!\n6. After your guests are all dressed up, it's time for a makeover! Have some makeup on-hand, as well as some nail polish for manicures. Also, give them to option of curling, straightening, and/or crimping their hair.\n7. After everyone's makeovers are finished, announce the \"Best-Dressed Award\". Give them a prize similar to the winner of the \"Worst-Dressed Award\".\n8. Once the \"Best-Dressed Award\" has been handed out, it's time for a photo shoot! Take pictures of your guests in their best outfits.\n9. Have your guests be revealed to 'Stacy' and 'Clinton'. Make sure that Stacy and Clinton both say positive stuff about the guest's outfits. Make sure that the person playing Stacy London says \"Shut up!\" frequently (she says \"Shut up!\" whenever she's impressed with an outfit).\n10. Reveal your pictures of your guests in their worst outfits (Before) and their best outfits (after). This will be a lot of fun and will get a lot of laughs.\n"}

{"input": "How to hook up with an ex girlfriend?", "output": "## Get ready to hook up with your ex-girlfriend\n\n1. Keep it spontaneous. If you want to hook up with your ex without any strings attached and to have as much fun as possible, then you have to start off by being spontaneous. Don't call her or text her, asking what she's been up to. Instead, you should run into her at a club, a party, or just out in the middle of the day, and start charming her and letting her know that you want to hook up. If you call her or start checking in with her, then she may get the wrong impression and think you want something more than just hooking up. Treat it like meeting a new and exciting girl out at a bar and then bring her home.\n2. Let enough time pass. If you want to start hooking up with your ex, you should wait until at least a few weeks, if not a few months, have gone by before you start trying to hook up with your ex again. Even if you had an amicable and mutual break-up and there are no hard feelings, you should let the dust settle before you try to get back in bed with your ex, or things are bound to get complicated. Enough time should pass that you can see your ex as someone hot who you'd like to hook up with, instead of letting all of your old complicated feelings or emotions well up at the sight of her. Enough time should pass so you get rid of any anger or lingering resentment or bitterness.\n3. Let her know you want to hook up. Once enough time has passed and you've run into your ex, you should make it clear that you want to take her home. Don't tell her that she's beautiful and that you've missed her smile; instead, tell her that she looks great in her new dress and that you've missed her body. You don't have to be too subtle since you should already be pretty comfortable with each other -- just make sure she's feeling it, too. Don't give her a puppy-dog love gaze. Look her up and down and let her see that you think she looks hot. Be blunt. Ask her to come over or wait for an invitation to go to her place.\n4. Make your intentions clear. Before you even touch your ex's lips with your own, you should make your intentions and expectations clear. Tell her you want to hook up without any strings attached, that you're not looking to get back into the relationship, and that you just want to have a little fun. Let her know that you only want to see her to hook up, not to do all the date-y stuff that leads to hooking up. Don't be a jerk. It's not cool to lead on your ex, hook up with her again, and then tell her that you're not really looking to reconnect.\n5. Make sure you're on the same page. Keep in mind that, when you're about to hook up with an ex, it's pretty unlikely that you're both on the same page. That is to say, it's almost always the case that one of you is still hurt, still reeling, and still emotionally vulnerable from the break up. It could be the case that she dumped you and you're pretending that you want to hook up when you really just want to get back together, or that she's totally hung up on you while you just want to get her in bed. But if you really are looking for the same things, then it's safe to go for it. Look into her eyes when you talk about your hook-up status. Does she really agree that it's a good idea, or does she clearly think it'll turn into something more? Think about how serious the relationship was in the beginning. If you were only together for a month or two, then you're both much more likely to be okay with just hooking up than you'd be if you dated for a year or two. Make sure you're both okay with also hooking up with other people. If you're not, then why not just get back together?\n\n\n## Hook up with your ex-girlfriend\n\n1. Make sure you only hook up. Though it sounds harsh, if you're going to hook up with an ex, then you should only hook up with her. Be honest about it. Don't make an excuse every time your ex wants to go somewhere public with you. Tell her that you're not looking for anything other than hooking up.\n2. Hook up sparingly. Hooking up with your ex can be fun and exciting, but that doesn't mean you should do it every night, because guess what? That's starting to look like a relationship. If you're basically only hooking up with your ex, then you're not letting yourself meet other girls or have any fun on the side. The more time you spend together, the more likely you both are to be hurt, so keep it fun and spontaneous instead of setting a hook-up date for every night of the week. Keep it fun and spontaneous. If you see her out, then take her home. If not, then don't call her or text her to find out where she is. You're not supposed to care that much, remember?\n3. Don't get too comfortable. It can be tricky to hook up with an ex without feeling too comfortable. No cuddling, no passionate kisses as you leave, and no hanging out around the house in sweatpants eating cold nachos from the night before. All of these signs show that you're too comfortable in the non-relationship and that you're on your way to dating again.\n4. Stay in control. If you want to hook up with your ex without any trouble, then you have to maintain control of the situation at all times. Don't let her set the terms of your hook up, and try to keep things at her place so you remain the master of your own domain. Don't cancel your plans to hang out with your buddies if she wants to hang out; tell her you'll hang out with her if she's free. This doesn't mean you should tell your ex exactly what to do; you should find a time and place that works for both of you, but you shouldn't fall prey to her needs.\n5. Keep your new relationship private. Don't hang out with your ex in front of your friends, go to a party with her because she doesn't want to show up alone, or tell your friends that you've been hooking up with her again. The more people you bring into it, the more complicated things will get, and you should keep it simple -- just between the two of you. If you start going out in public with her and hanging out with her friends, they'll immediately disapprove and tell your ex that she should set the terms for your relationship. If you bring her out in front of your friends, then she'll start to feel like your girlfriend again.\n6. Avoid \"lovey dovey\" stuff when you're hooking up. Maybe when you were dating, you would be tender with your woman, telling her how beautiful she is, how much you love her, and how much you love the little dimples in her cheeks. Well, all of your Romeo-moves have to go out the door at this point, or she'll get the wrong picture. She'll think, \"He said I'm beautiful -- he must still love me,\" or \"He ran his hands through my hair -- it has to mean something.\" By doing this, you'll be leading her on and making her feel like you still want to date her. You can tell her how hot she is and how much you love her body, but stick to the sexy -- not the tender -- compliments if you want it to last.\n\n\n## Know when to stop hook up\n\n1. Stop if one of you starts developing feelings again. Unfortunately, it'll be hard to keep hooking up with your ex without having one of you develop feelings for the other person again. As soon as that happens, you'll have to push the eject button on the non-relationship, or things will only get worse from there. Unless you're still really in love with your ex and are using your hook up moves to win back her heart -- incidentally, a terrible idea -- you should cease and desist the second you or she shows signs of having feelings. If you start getting that achy feeling in your heart and start musing about what a great relationship you had while knowing it can never work, then it's time to leave. If your ex tells you she misses you, sends you sweet (not sexy) texts, or says she wishes you could do some couple-y things together, then it's time to bow out. If you have to end the \"relationship\" for this reason, explain yourself first. You shouldn't be a jerk just because it's over.\n2. Stop if one of you starts liking someone else. If one of you starts developing feelings for someone else, even if you haven't pursued that person, you should end up the hook-up period. Hooking up with your ex is something to do when you both want to get some action and are bored because there are few romantic prospects in your lives. But if one of you does start liking someone else, it's time to stop hooking up so you have room to explore those feelings. If you know your ex has a crush on someone else, you're doing her a disservice by continuing to hook up with her and taking up her time. If you start liking another girl, she won't want anything to do with you if she knows that you're hooking up with an ex-girlfriend.\n3. Stop when you've fallen into a routine. Hooking up with your ex should last a month or two at most before things start to get more serious. Even if you're both trying as hard as you can to keep things casual, if you've fallen into a rhythm, basically feel like you're dating, and know exactly when you'll see each other next, then it's time to stop hooking up. If you know when you'll see your ex next, and you stop feeling a thrill at the prospect of hooking up, then the fun is over. You can't expect the hook up to last more than a month or two without it leading to something more. Be realistic.\n4. Stop if you start fighting like a couple. As soon as you start fighting again, you should end the relationship. If you're not actually dating, then you shouldn't be fighting. It's that simple. If you hear her say, \"Where is this taking us?\" or \"What does all of this mean?\" Then she's already back in relationship mode, and your hook up sessions have gone too far. You shouldn't be fighting about anything one of you is doing wrong, because you should only be hooking up, right? It may be tempting to fight with your ex again if you're used to it, but remember that it won't lead you anywhere except back where you were -- a bad relationship.\n5. Stop if you're no longer having fun. The whole point of hooking up with your ex is so that both of you can enjoy yourselves, get some sexual pleasure, and have fun without any strings attached. If you're not feeling the hook up anymore, if you feel like you're only in it out of obligation, or if you're hooking up with your ex just because you're bored, then it's time to start looking for someone new. You weren't having fun before and that's why the relationship ended. Be honest about ending the hook-up session. Don't just start avoiding or ignoring your ex. Let her know it's time to move on.\n"}
{"input": "How to set up an aquarium?", "output": "Setting up an aquarium can be quite difficult that involves a lot of patience, maintenance, and testing before you can even add any tank inhabitants. Despite this, setting up your aquarium correctly is vital for your pets' health and longevity. There are different ways to set up different types of aquariums.\n\n## Choose an aquarium type\n\n1. Decide if you want a freshwater aquarium or saltwater aquarium. There are many differences between having a freshwater aquarium versus having a saltwater aquarium. These differences include how you initially set up the aquarium and all ongoing care, maintenance, everyday chores, and costs requirements. There are several key issues you will need to consider while you choose:\n2. Think about the size of tank you\u2019d like. A small fish tank set up is generally more economical than a large fish tank. There are several issues you should consider when choosing the size of your tank:\n3. Choose what type of saltwater aquarium you\u2019d like to set up. There are three main saltwater aquarium types: Fish Only, Fish Only with Live Rock (FOWLR), and the Reef Tank. Fish Only Tanks: As the name suggests, this tank only houses saltwater fish. It is the least expensive way to set up a saltwater aquarium. However, it does have its disadvantages. Fish Only tanks take longer to set up, require more frequent tank maintenance and testing, and have a shorter shelf life than the other types of saltwater aquariums. Fish Only with Live Rock: FOWLR tanks are set up like Fish Only tanks but with the addition of live rock and better aquarium lighting. The live rock acts as a natural biological filter for saltwater and keeps your tank healthier than a Fish Only tank. A live rock has hundreds of tiny creatures and biological organisms living inside and on the surface of the rock. Reef Tank: If you choose this type of saltwater aquarium, you are most likely looking towards having invertebrates, corals, or anemones as the main focus of your aquarium and fish are just an afterthought. Reef tanks require daily water quality checks, high lighting levels, extra water supplements, heavy duty filtration systems and are generally the most expensive to maintain. Reef Tanks are recommended for more experienced aquarium hobbyists.\n4. Determine what the correct lighting and heating for your fish is. The kind of lighting and the temperature of your aquarium depend on what kind of aquarium you have and who your tank inhabitants are. The type of light you choose also affects the overall temperature of your tank. Aquariums that are Fish Only: This means your freshwater tank will not have real or live plants in it. In this case, you will most likely be using fluorescent lights that are between 18 and 40 watts. Freshwater aquariums with plants: The type of lighting you\u2019ll need will depend on the depth of your tank, the plant species you have, and the desired growth rate of the plant. Usually, you should provide 2 to 5 watts of light per gallon in a planted freshwater aquarium. Always research and consult with your aquarium expert when you plan to have plants in your tank. Saltwater Reef Tanks: These tanks need high levels of light that are characteristic of high output fluorescent and metal halide lamps. Some corals may even need more intense levels of light that can be achieved with T5-HO, Very High Output (VHO), and metal halide lights.\n5. Choose the appropriate type of filter or filters for your tank. All filters have three functions to them, which include mechanically filtering the water by trapping or removing free floating particles, biologically filtering the water by growing good bacteria, and chemically filtering the water by dissolving wastes. There are various types of filter:\n\n\n## Set up a freshwater aquarium\n\n1. Gather all the equipment needed for your aquarium. Before buying your fish, you need to prepare the aquarium. A typical freshwater aquarium needs:\n2. Clean your tank, gravel, decorations, and filters. Never use soap or detergents to clean your tank. Using soaps or detergents can seriously injure and damage your tank inhabitants. Simply wash your tank and equipment with hot water. Use a sponge or clean washcloth and scrub the inside of your tank. Then hose it down to rid your tank of any impurities. Wash and soak your aquarium gravel or sand in a bucket. Use a pasta strainer to separate the dirtied water from the gravel. Wash and massage your filter\u2019s cartridges under the tap or in a bucket. This is very important, especially if you\u2019re using a carbon filter. Massaging or rubbing the filter activates the carbon inside the cartridge. Wash all decorations in clean water.\n3. Set up your aquarium. This means putting your tank on its stand, filling the tank with gravel, arranging your decorations and airstones, and setting up the lighting and heating for your aquarium. If you are using an undergravel filter, place the bottom plates into your tank and attach all necessary tubes, airline, gang valves, and air pumps before adding your gravel. Don\u2019t plug in your filter. Set it up and place it in the correct position but don\u2019t turn it on until you have water in the tank. Having it on without water can damage your filter.\n4. Add water to your freshwater aquarium. It\u2019s vital you treat your water with conditioner to remove chlorine and chloramine. You can find water conditioners at your local pet store with instructions on how much to add depending on how big of a tank you have. Don\u2019t fill the tank with water until you are sure of your aquarium\u2019s layout. It can get quite messy if you stick your hand in a full tank to move things around. Place a plate over your gravel to avoid messing up your tank layout. Pour water directly onto the plate so the pressure of a stream of water won\u2019t make a hole in your gravel or move your decorations around. Remove the place once your tank is full.\n5. Turn on your aquarium\u2019s filter, lights, and heater. This will begin your tank\u2019s nitrogen cycle. Ensure your tank is safe electrically before turning or plugging everything in. A power cord in the wrong place can cause serious injury to you.\n6. Wait a few days before adding fish to your tank. The nitrogen cycle takes a few days for it to completely stabilize. You might notice your tank becoming cloudy which means the cycle is kicking in. You can add some hardy fish like feeder goldfish to your tank to speed up the nitrogen cycle. However, don\u2019t expect the fish to survive, as the harsh conditions of a new aquarium can be quite stressful and inhospitable. Use a nitrate testing kit to ensure your aquarium is at its best quality before adding your fish.\n\n\n## Set up a saltwater aquarium\n\n1. Gather all the equipment needed for your aquarium. Before buying your fish, you need to prepare the aquarium. A typical saltwater aquarium needs:\n2. Clean your tank, decorations, and filters. Never use soap or detergents to clean your tank. Using soaps or detergents can seriously injure and damage your tank inhabitants. Simply wash your tank and equipment with hot water. Use a sponge or clean washcloth and scrub the inside of your tank. Then hose it down to rid your tank of any impurities. Wash and massage your filter\u2019s cartridges under the tap or in a bucket. This is very important, especially if you\u2019re using a carbon filter. Massaging or rubbing the filter activates the carbon inside the cartridge. Wash all decorations in clean water. Your substrate will be cleaned after your aquarium is set up.\n3. Set up your aquarium. This means putting your tank on its stand, arranging your power heads, and setting up the lighting and heating for your aquarium. If you are adding a live rock, do not add substrate or decorations to your tank. You must cure your live rock before you can do this. Don\u2019t plug in your filter. Set it up and place it in the correct position but don\u2019t turn it on until you have water in the tank. Having it on without water can damage your filter.\n4. Add saltwater to your aquarium. The saltwater mix you purchased should have detailed instructions on how to prepare your saltwater. Generally, you will be mixing room temperature water with the salt mix in a bucket or several buckets. If you don\u2019t have enough buckets, you will need to prepare your water in parts or mix the salt right in the tank. Check your salt levels with your refractometer. Typically, the specific gravity reading should be between 1.021 and 1.024 depending on the temperature of your water. Measuring the specific gravity of your saltwater means measuring the density of your water since adding salt to water increases the density of water.\n5. Cure your live rock. If you have FOWLR tank, you will need to start the process of curing your live rock, which could take up to 2 months to complete. To begin the process:\n6. Prepare your substrate before adding it to your tank. Before adding any substrate to your tank, you will need to prepare a bucket of saltwater to help clean it. Add your substrate into the bucket and stir. This allows the dust and dirt from your substrate to rise for you to siphon out with your aquarium vacuum. Use a cup or ladle to add your clean substrate to the tank. You will need to drain more water out of your aquarium to accommodate the addition of your substrate and any decorations.\n7. Wait a few days before adding fish to your aquarium. Thoroughly check your aquarium\u2019s water salinity, pH, ammonia, nitrate, and hardness levels using your test kits before adding any fish. The ideal readings for a saltwater aquarium with a live rock are:\n"}

{"input": "How to match paint colors?", "output": "Whether you need to touch up a scratch on your living room wall or your child wants their bedroom to be the exact same color as their favorite toy, it can be difficult to find a perfect match to an existing paint color. Luckily, there are plenty of tricks and tools that can help you find the color you\u2019re looking from, including using paint samples, smartphone apps, and in-store computerized color matching!\n\n## Match paint without a sample\n\n1. Clean the area you're trying to paint match. Over time, fingerprints, dust, and dirt can collect on the surface of an object or a wall, and this can make the paint color seem darker than it actually is. To make sure you're testing the actual color, wipe the paint down with a damp, soapy sponge, and allow it to dry completely before you try to match the color. In addition to giving you a more accurate color match, cleaning the wall will help the new paint adhere better.\n2. Scrape off a 1 in (2.5 cm) sample of drywall paint with a razor knife. If you\u2019re trying to match paint on sheetrock or drywall, the easiest way to get a perfect match is to bring a sample with you to the paint store. Use a utility knife to score a square into the surface of the sheetrock about \u20448 in (0.32 cm) deep, then peel away the paper. Place the sample in a plastic bag or an envelope so it doesn\u2019t get smudged before you get to the paint store. Once the store has analyzed the color, dab a little of the paint onto a corner of the sample and let it dry to ensure it\u2019s a perfect match.\n3. Bring the item you\u2019re matching to the paint store if it's portable. Thanks to the computerized color-matching technology at most paint stores, you can match almost anything! If you\u2019re trying to find a paint that\u2019s the same color as an object, you can bring that object in with you when you go to buy paint. The staff at the paint store will then scan the item and come up with an exact or near-exact digital match to the color of the object. If there\u2019s not an existing color that matches your object, the paint store can mix one up for you.\n\n\n## Find a match with an app\n\n1. Download a paint-matching app if you can\u2019t take a sample. Most major paint brands have their own apps for matching paint colors, including Sherwin-Williams, BEHR, Glidden, and Valspar. Visit the app store on your smartphone and choose an app that will scan your wall color and provide you with a color match. If you remember the brand you used originally, download their app. If you don\u2019t know the brand, try a few different apps to see which gives you the closest match, or try an app like Paint My Place which uses multiple paint brands.\n2. Scan your paint in natural lighting for the best result. Differences in lighting can make your paint more yellow or more blue, depending on which type of light is being used. To avoid these inconsistencies, try to test your paint sample in an area with plenty of natural light if you can, like near an open window or door. Since natural light changes throughout the day, it may help to take a color reading in the morning, afternoon, and evening. If your room doesn\u2019t have much natural light, use the room\u2019s primary light source to test the paint. Incandescent lights will make paint seem warmer, while fluorescent lights look cooler. Halogen bulbs more closely resemble daylight.\n3. Test the paint in an inconspicuous area to make sure it\u2019s a good match. Differences in lighting and cameras can make digital paint matching imprecise. If you purchase paint based on the results you get from an app, be sure to test it somewhere where the difference won\u2019t be obvious. Let the paint dry completely before you check whether it\u2019s a match, since wet paint can look like a different color at first.\n4. Purchase or borrow a color scanner for a more precise match. Apps rely on your smartphone\u2019s camera to get a color match, but you can get more accurate results with a small device that scans paint colors using an independent camera with its own lighting. If you\u2019ll be doing a lot of color matching, it can be worth the investment. These color scanners are $65-$100 at most home stores and connect to your phone via Bluetooth.\n\n\n## Use a color sample\n\n1. Take a picture of the original color before you go to the paint store. If you\u2019re planning to pick up color samples from the paint store, take along a photo of the original paint. Pictures won\u2019t give you an exact color match, but they can be helpful if you\u2019re trying to remember the general hue. If you can, try snapping pictures at different times of day, since the changes in lighting will make the paint look different. If you\u2019re in a hurry and don\u2019t have time to wait a few hours for the light to change, try taking pictures with the flash on and off, or with the main light on, followed by lamplight. Holding up a true white piece of paper or cardstock in the picture can help your camera to automatically correct the color balance.\n2. Choose a handful of samples to bring home with you. The lighting in the paint aisle won\u2019t be the same as it is in your home, and different shades can seem really similar, so it\u2019s important to bring the paint samples to the wall to compare the colors. Choose a handful of colors that seem close to the shade you want to match. If you\u2019re not sure what brand the original color was, be sure to get shades from several different brands, as well. If you like, you can also purchase or borrow a fan deck of colors from the paint store so you\u2019ll have access to all of the shades a particular brand offers.\n3. Tape the samples to the wall and examine them at different times of day. It can be tempting to just hold up the samples and immediately choose which one is the closest, but since the color of the room will change slightly as the sun moves throughout the day, you should hang the samples and come back to them every couple of hours. Of course, if none of the samples are a match, you will probably be able to tell right away. If one sample is a match early in the day and another matches better in the evening, ask the paint store if they can mix a shade in between.\n4. Paint a small section of each color on the wall if you\u2019re still not sure. Most paint stores will sell you a small can of paint that you can use to paint a sample. If you can\u2019t decide between 2 or 3 different shades, purchase a sample size of each. Paint a small swatch of each color onto the wall and look at them for a few days before making your final decision. In addition to changes in light throughout the day, changes in weather can also affect your paint color. Your swatches might look different on a sunny day than they do on a day when that\u2019s overcast.\n"}

Assuming a single-threaded application (as most are), your entire application will stop responding, rather than just delaying an operation as you probably intended. Note that it may be fine to use Sleep in pure console application as there are no \"events\" to handle or on separate thread (also ```Task.Delay``` is better option).\nIn addition to timers and ```Sleep``` you can use ```Task.Delay``` which is asynchronous version of ```Sleep``` that does not block thread from processing events (if used properly - don't turn it into infinite sleep with ```.Wait()```). \n``` public async void ClickHandler(...)\n {\n      // whatever you need to do before delay goes here\n      await Task.Delay(2000);\n      // whatever you need to do after delay.\n }\n```\nThe same ```await Task.Delay(2000)``` can be used in a ```Main``` method of a console application if you use C# 7.1 (Async main on MSDN blogs).\nNote: delaying operation with ```Sleep``` has benefit of avoiding race conditions that comes from potentially starting multiple operations with timers/```Delay```. Unfortunately freezing UI-based application is not acceptable so you need to think about what will happen if you start multiple delays (i.e. if it is triggered by a button click) - consider disabling such button, or canceling the timer/task or making sure delayed operation can be done multiple times safely."}

{"input": "How to make the most of your physical therapy?", "output": "## Physical therapy payments\n\n1. Ask your doctor to recommend the best physical therapist for your condition. Many people have to decide based on who their insurance will cover; however, some physical therapists specialize in certain conditions and can offer expertise that an insurance-covered physical therapist cannot. Choose based on what you can afford and how important your timely recovery is.\n2. Call your insurance to ask how many visits are covered. Many insurance plans have caps on physical therapy treatments, from 10 to 35. After severe injuries, you may be able to apply to the insurance company for more treatments, if they are absolutely necessary.\n3. Ask the physical therapy office if you can have a discounted rate, if you are paying out of pocket. Insurance companies often get a discounted rate, so they may afford you the same price. Ask the physical therapist directly, rather than the secretary, because it is the physical therapist that is agreeing to alter their wages.\n\n\n## Physical therapy sessions\n\n1. Have a positive attitude toward physical therapy. Will power and optimism during a recovery are almost as important as doctor's care. Your commitment to the exercises will have a direct correlation to the swiftness and completeness of your recovery.\n2. Wear athletic shoes and loose-fitting, flexible clothing to all physical therapy sessions. If you have to go to your session straight from work, then keep spare exercise clothing in your bag or car. This type of clothing allows you the full range of motion in your exercises and keeps your regular clothes clear of analgesic creams or massage oils.\n3. Drink plenty of water while you are exercising. Although this is a general rule, it is even more important when you are healing from an injury. Stay hydrated throughout the day and bring a water bottle to your session.\n4. Show up early to each appointment. Your physical therapist may allow you to warm up before the session, on a machine or by stretching. This also makes certain that you are never late, because you will be charged for the session from the moment your appointment time arrives. Make sure to be 15 minutes early for your first appointment. You will need to fill out insurance and health forms. Bring a list of your medications and other current treatments.\n5. Discuss your goals with your physical therapist at your first meeting. Pain and injury are different for everyone, so you must make it clear whether you want to return to work, get rid of pain, walk without weight supports or run a marathon. Tell the physical therapist how many sessions you can afford, so the plan can be adjusted for what you will do during your sessions and what you can continue at home. Remember that this may need to be adjusted on the future, based on your progress. In most cases, the harder you work doing prescribed exercises at home, the fewer office sessions you will need to have.\n6. Ask your physical therapist to give you a list of prescribed exercises, with diagrams. They should establish what and when you should be doing each exercise, so that you are clear about your \"homework.\" Ask the physical therapist to show you each exercise as well as having you do repetitions in the office.\n7. Tell your physical therapist whenever something is painful. Mistakes can be made if you do not communicate properly about your pain levels. The physical therapist can also tell you what pain is natural to the healing process and what is unnatural, allowing the exercises to be adjusted.\n8. Ask to be treated by the same physical therapist every time. This provides consistency, familiarity and a greater chance that you will be able to accomplish your goals.\n9. Ask plenty of questions. You must be proactive about your treatment. If you don't understand why you are doing something or how you should do something, you are more likely to refrain from the exercise and fail to progress.\n10. Report your progress at the beginning of each physical therapy session. Make sure you tell your therapist any new pain or problems, as well as your positive progress. They will usually write this on your chart to ensure you won't have complications from the regime.\n11. Leave your cell phone and personal problems at the door when you go to physical therapy. You must use this valuable time to focus on health and your body. You may need to learn to recognize your body's warning signs, which is hard to do when you are distracted.\n\n\n## Physical therapy at home\n\n1. Create a schedule to do your physical therapy exercises at home. Do not leave it up to chance whether you have the time or not. They are as important as doctor-prescribed medicine and should be treated as a priority during your day.\n2. Set aside a space to do physical therapy. Keep a corner of your home ready with a yoga mat or exercise ball, so that you can do a few repetitions when you have some free time. This will help you get into the mentality of exercise as a lifestyle choice.\n3. Take the prescribed therapy exercises seriously. If you are advised to do them once per day, do them every day, and if you are asked to do them 3 times per day, do them 3 times per day. Frequent exercises are usually prescribed when there is a limited time for you to regain your mobility during the healing process, and they should be treated with gravity.\n4. Progress to more repetitions or sets as you get stronger. Many physical therapists will tell you to add 5 repetitions or 1 more set when the exercise becomes easy. You may also be asked to add more weight to your exercises.\n5. Ask the physical therapist for an appropriate regimen to continue after you no longer attend sessions. They should be able to adjust an exercise regime according to your particular health problems. Establish goals that you should reach 3 months, 6 months and a year into the future.\n"}

{"input": "How to thicken facial hair?", "output": "If you\u2019re dissatisfied with the patchiness of your beard or mustache, there are several easy steps you can take to thicken your facial hair. Many of these involve making simple lifestyle changes, like changing your diet or exercising more. If these easy techniques don\u2019t give you the results you\u2019re looking for, there are several products you can try out, which may either make your beard thicker or make it appear so. If these don\u2019t work and you really want fuller facial hair, there\u2019s always the option of getting a beard transplant.\n\n## Make lifestyle change\n\n1. Eat a healthy diet to get the vitamins and nutrients your beard needs. Like any other part of your body, your beard needs vitamins and nutrients to grow properly. Be sure your diet includes a balanced mix of whole grains, lean protein, healthy fats, fruits, and vegetables. Remember to also drink plenty of water and other fluids to stay hydrated. Since your hair is protein-based, it\u2019s especially important that you eat plenty of protein. Sources of protein include: lean meats, eggs, dairy products, beans, legumes, seeds, and nuts. Adult men should aim to consume around 0.84 grams (0.030 oz) of protein per 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of body weight.\n2. Exercise to help stimulate hair growth. Being physically active on a regular basis will help boost your blood circulation. Better blood circulation will allow more nutrients to reach your hair roots, helping to boost hair growth. Try to get at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise every day by jogging, taking a brisk walk, or riding a bike. If you don\u2019t exercise much, ease into an exercise regime gradually so that you don\u2019t injure yourself.\n3. Reduce stress in your life to keep your hair healthy. Constant, high levels of stress can make your hair more brittle and even cause it to fall out. You can minimize stress in your life by getting enough sleep every night, exercising regularly, and participating in relaxing activities. Aim to get between 8-10 hours of sleep a night if you\u2019re a teenager, and at least 7 hours of sleep if you\u2019re over 18 years of age. Activities like yoga, meditation, and reading can also help you relax.\n\n\n## Take care of your facial hair\n\n1. Let your beard grow for at least 4 weeks. You\u2019ll need to let your facial hair grow out a while before you can determine just how thick it looks. While your beard may look patchy and uneven after a week of letting it grow out, after 4 weeks, it may actually look lush and full. Try not to start trimming your beard too soon. Don\u2019t trim any hair until you reach the 3rd week or so. Itchiness usually fades after the 2nd week of growing out your facial hair.\n2. Comb and brush your facial hair to cover patchy spots. As you let your facial hair grow out, comb and brush it daily. Comb areas that are thicker towards the patchier areas you want to cover. This will help train the hairs to grow in that direction. If you plan to keep a beard long term, consider investing in a quality beard brush.\n3. Apply a beard oil to your beard to soften and nourish it. In addition to eating a healthy and well-balanced diet, using beard oil is another great way to supply your beard with the vitamins and nutrients it needs to look full and healthy. Apply beard oil to your facial hair once a day to begin with. Apply your beard oil soon after you get out of the shower, when your beard is still slightly damp, but not dripping wet. Beard oil will also help reduce the itchiness of your facial hair during the first 2 weeks of growth.\n\n\n## Use hair-growth products\n\n1. Dye your facial hair to make it look thicker. If some of your facial hairs are blond, light brown, or gray, your facial hair may look thinner and patchier than it really is. Dyeing your facial hair a darker color will make these hairs more visible, making your beard or mustache look fuller and more uniform. You can find hair dye made for coloring facial hair at your local drug store. When dyeing your facial hair, follow the directions on the container closely, so you don\u2019t end up with dye spots on your skin.\n2. Take biotin supplements daily to thicken your facial hair. Biotin supplements may help thicken your facial hair by strengthening your hair\u2019s keratin infrastructure, giving your facial hair a fuller appearance. You can find biotin supplements over-the-counter at your local drug store. Biotin supplements, unfortunately, won\u2019t make hair grow in places where there isn\u2019t any to begin with. Products marketed as beard-growing pills are usually a combination of biotin, vitamin C, zinc, and other vitamins. The claims of these and other supplements haven\u2019t been proven in clinical trials, so take them with a hefty grain of salt.\n3. Apply Minoxidil (aka Rogaine) to your facial hair. Minoxidil helps stimulates blood circulation, which allows more nutrients and hormones to reach your hair follicles. This helps encourage growth of your hair. You can buy Minoxidil as a foam or liquid. You can purchase Minoxidil at your local drug store. The 2 most common side-effects users of Minoxidil experience are lower blood pressure and dry, irritated skin.\n4. Look into getting a beard transplant if other methods don\u2019t work. A beard transplant involves a doctor taking hairs from the back of your scalp and transferring them to areas on your face where you want thicker hair. After the procedure, it may take a few months for you to see its final results. The procedure typically takes several hours and requires the application of a local anesthetic. A beard transplant can cost upwards of $7,000.\n"}

{"input": "How to dress for a 90s party?", "output": "At the moment, 1990s-themed parties are hugely popular and can be immensely fun if you show up in the right outfit. Start by doing some research into popular celebrities and film or TV characters from the decade to get a sense for the fashions of the 90s. Then decide whether you want to copy an iconic look or riff off a popular trend. Choose one of the decade\u2019s overarching trends and try to emulate the trend\u2019s color palette and overall silhouettes in your outfit. Once you\u2019re dressed the part, \u201cparty like it\u2019s 1999\u201d!\n\n## Recreate a 90s grunge look\n\n1. Opt for drab, slouchy clothes. Create an outfit made up of dark, murky colors and oversized garments. Try pairing baggy ripped jeans with a slouchy striped sweater in drab hues. Or throw an oversized, boxy leather jacket over a lived-in t-shirt featuring your favorite 90s grunge band. Look to Kurt Cobain for grunge inspiration. You could also try a slouchy top half with an acid-wash miniskirt and shredded tights for a more girly take on grunge. Finish off your look with long stringy hair and add some red eye makeup under your eyes to get that exhausted grunge appearance.\n2. Mix in satin, lace, and floral prints for a romantic grunge look. Try a more glamorous take on grunge by assembling an outfit inspired by Courtney Love. Start with a feminine piece like a lace-trimmed satin slip dress or a cotton floral-printed dress. Then layer grunge elements over it. Drape an oversized cardigan or plaid flannel shirt over your dress and accessorize with chokers and chains and combat boots. Add smudged black eyeliner and deep red lipstick to complete your look.\n3. Don\u2019t forget to add an oversized plaid flannel shirt to your outfit. These shirts were a staple in 90s grunge. The oversized flannel plaid button-down can be worn with practically anything. Just be sure to pick one that\u2019s about 3 sizes too big and that features dull, drab colors. Throw your flannel shirt over a lived-in graphic t-shirt or a feminine dress. Or tie it around your waist for a casual, careless look.\n4. Incorporate acid-wash denim into your look. Opt for light- or medium-wash hues and acid or stonewashed textures. Try using it sparingly with 1 garment, like an oversized denim jacket or ripped baggy jeans. If you have time to do some DIY-ing, try creating a patchwork denim dress or skirt. If you want to really make an entrance, go all-out with a head-to-toe denim outfit. Acid-wash denim can also be glammed up with silver-toned accessories and more formal silhouettes. Look up the iconic denim outfits worn by Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake to see what\u2019s possible.\n5. Finish off your grunge look with a pair of combat boots. Whether you\u2019re wearing baggy bottoms or black tights slip into a pair of combat boots. Aim for shoes in the style of Doc Martens or Timberland. Try a pair of second-hand shoes \u2013 the more worn-in, the better.\n\n\n## Dress like a 90s prep\n\n1. Start with bold plaid suiting. For guys, this means choosing plaid trousers or a boxy plaid sports jacket with roomy trousers. For women, pick a bold-colored tweed or plaid blazer and pleated miniskirt to achieve the schoolgirl look that was prevalent in the 90s. Add over-the-knee white socks and Mary Jane shoes to a plaid miniskirt. For a sassier schoolgirl look, try a white crop top or tied button-down under the blazer to show off your belly button. Model your outfit after the costumes in Clueless or Britney Spears\u2019 \u201c...Baby One More Time\u201d look. You can either recreate one of these iconic costumes or pick out elements to inspire an original outfit.\n2. Mix brightly-colored tops, bottoms, and sunglasses. The fashion of the 1990s contained some holdovers from the 1980s, most notably the saturated, fluorescent colors and prints. Work these into your preppy outfit with a color-blocked windbreaker. Or pair a bold-colored top with equally saturated trousers in a clashing color. Accessorize with Oakley-style sunglasses with slim oval or rectangular rims featuring tinted lenses. Play with color combinations like orange and pink, yellow and blue, or red and purple. For a masculine high school prep look, wear an oversized letterman jacket, a pastel-colored polo with a popped collar, and pastel trousers. Alternatively, try creating a more casual and youthful outfit with all of this color, like those worn in Saved By the Bell.\n3. Try an oversized button-down and trousers for a take on 90s business casual. Graduate your preppy look to a yuppie one and riff on the decade\u2019s emerging business casual look. Pair pleated trousers with a boxy sports jacket, or choose chinos and an oversized but tucked-in dress shirt with bright vertical stripes. Opt for a black crewneck t-shirt under a boxy sports jacket. Re-watch Friends and pay close attention to the workwear outfits shown.\n\n\n## Follow 90s urban trend\n\n1. Choose bold and baggy pieces for a hip-hop or R&B-inspired outfit. Artists of the time mixed brightly colored African-influenced prints with high-end sportswear and baggy bottoms and jackets. For a men\u2019s outfit, combine these influences in an all-oversized look. For a women\u2019s outfit, pair baggier pieces with fitted pieces to nail the look while showing off your curves. Get inspired by the outfits worn by girl groups like TLC or Salt-N-Pepa or male soloists like Ice Cube and Tupac Shakur. As a woman, try either pairing a baggy jacket with slim leggings or a crop top with loose-fitting cargo pants. Accessorize with big hoop earrings or a bandana.\n2. Choose athletic pieces like track gear and chunky sneakers. Air Jordans were huge at the time, so pick out a pair of flashy, bulky sneakers. Try a muscle tank or a zip-up track jacket with stripes running down the sleeves. Beyond hip-hop artists, quite a few 90s boy bands sported the athletic-inspired outfits. Check out photos of Dream Street for reference. Rep your favorite team with a swishy starter jacket or old sports jersey. Women can get the look by slightly altering the silhouette. Try a high ponytail and a fitted crop top over low-slung track pants and platform sneakers \u00e0 la Sporty Spice.\n3. Top off your outfit with a 90s bucket hat, snapback hat, or scrunchie. Popular 90s headgear crossed the boundaries from hip-hop to preppy, so feel free to experiment. Bucket hats are great for masculine and feminine looks alike. Try a snapback for a more masculine effect or a scrunchie to make your outfit more girly. Tie your hair up in a high ponytail or 2 pigtails with a colorful scrunchie. To get an authentic-looking 90s outfit, pick up a snapback hat from the decade itself. Consider wearing your snapback hat backward with the adjustable strap at your forehead. Choose a classic bucket hat in a solid-color canvas, or go wild with a plaid or fuzzy-textured bucket hat.\n4. Accessorize with chains. Try a chain belt slung low on the hips over flared denim. For a more masculine look, wear a thick chain connected to your belt loop and wallet. You can lean towards bling with elaborate gold chains. Or keep your look grungey with heavy silver-toned or gunmetal chains.\n\n\n## Sport 90s mainstream and high fashion\n\n1. Choose loud prints and graphics to recall casual 90s apparel. In the 90s, practically no print was off-limits. Play around with animal prints, paisley, small florals, plaid, Hawaiian florals, and camouflage. Or throw on a baggy graphic t-shirt featuring your favorite 90s bans or TV show. Skate culture blew up in the 90s. Try a skater-inspired t-shirt and look to characters like Travis in Clueless for ideas. Try camo and animal prints in either natural colors or bold, saturated hues.\n2. Wear flares, halter tops, and flashy fabrics to nail the 90s disco revival. Just as the 1990s are being revived in the 2010s, the 1970s were being revived in the 1990s! This revealed itself through halter tops, flared jeans, platform shoes, and materials like sequins and colorful pleather. For women, try a pair of hip-hugging flare jeans with a cropped halter top to get the best of the-90s-does-the-70s fashion.\n3. Try a metallic mini-dress for supermodel-inspired evening attire. Before the year 2000 (Y2K), space- and tech-inspired silvery, frosted colors and fabrics were popular. Recreate this look with a shiny silver or frosted pastel dress. Look for one with tank or spaghetti straps and either an empire waist or a shift dress silhouette. Add maribou trim to your dress\u2019 hemline to get even more in the 90s mood. Try pairing pastel platform heels or strappy silver stilettos with your dress. Look at photos of supermodels like Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell, as well as the iconic party dresses worn in Romy and Michele, for inspiration.\n4. Accessorize with popular 90s jewelry items like chokers and mood rings. For women, pick out a black plastic stretchy choker to add some 90s sass to your outfit. Slip on a color-changing mood ring to really get in the mood. Piercings were popular during the 90s, so slip on a fake belly-button ring (for ladies) or a small stud or hoop (for guys) if you don\u2019t already have a piercing. Sport a brightly colored and patterned snap bracelet on your wrist. Add a hemp bracelet or choker to a slouchy masculine outfit.\n"}
{"input": "How to wear long coats?", "output": "A long coat is a nice item to have in any closet, especially for people living in colder climates. There is a variety of styles of long coats as well as ways you can wear them. Make your long coat work for you by finding a style that fits you, dressing it down for casual daily wear, or adding it on top of a dressy outfit for a formal occasion.\n\n## Choose the right coat\n\n1. Try a fit-and-flare coat for the illusion of a thinner waist. For a long coat that hides a thick waist, try a fit-and-flare style. These coats fit tighter around the waist and then flare out at the hips. The tops are often double-breasted, and there are strategically placed seams on them to create a thinner look. Solid black and vertical stripes also make people look thinner. Experiment with these colors if you\u2019re concerned about making your waist look thinner.\n2. Balance out wide hips with a voluminous collar on your coat. If you\u2019d like to create the illusion of smaller hips, choose a coat that has a large collar such as a shawl collar or large faux-fur collar. The volume of the collar will draw attention away from the bottom half of your coat.\n3. Add curves to a narrow frame with a belted coat. Belts add dimension to long, straight coats. Look for a long coat with a thick wrap-around belt if you\u2019d like to make your thin frame look curvier. Subtle pleats around the waist also help to add curves. Colors and patterns that add dimension for a thin person include light colors and plaid.\n4. Hide a rounder belly with a full-length men\u2019s coat. Most younger men today wear knee-length long coats, but that length looks best on trim men who can wear a more form-fitting coat. Full-length coats go past the knee to the mid-calf, and are nice for disguising a heavier figure. Full-length coats are also considerably warmer, so they are ideal for cold climates.\n5. Go with a double-breasted knee-length coat if you\u2019re petite. Long coats can easily swallow up a short person. A way to solve this is to keep the coat around knee-length or just past your knees. Double-breasted coats with a large envelope collar keep a proportioned look to a longer coat worn on a petite person. If you are of an average or taller height, you can easily pull off full-length coats that go past the knee to your mid-calf or below.\n6. Do the hug test to make sure the coat isn\u2019t too small. It\u2019s easy to buy a long coat that\u2019s too small because the length of the coat may make you think it fits you. To check, try the coat on and wrap your arms around yourself, trying to touch the opposite shoulder with each hand. If the coat feels really tight in the shoulders or elbows, you should go with the next size up. You can also check the sleeve length by holding your arms straight out in front of you. If the sleeves go up 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) past your wrists, you probably need the next size up. The sleeve end should fall within 1 in (2.5 cm) of you wrist when your arms are up, and go almost to your knuckles when they are down.\n7. Check that the shoulder seams line up with your shoulders. On a properly fitting coat, the shoulder seams should line up with your shoulders. If they go down near your biceps, the coat is either too big or it is supposed to have an oversized shape to it. Either try on the next size down, or confirm that oversized is the style that you\u2019re going for. Consider getting a coat tailored for you if cannot find a coat that fits correctly across your chest and shoulders as well as the length of your arms.\n8. Choose a wool coat for the longest winter wear. Long coats come in a variety of fabrics, but if you\u2019re planning to wear your coat for a long time during the winter, invest in 100% wool or a wool-cashmere blend. Coats made with all cashmere tend to show wear much faster. If you intend to wear your jacket in fall, spring, or summer weather, you have more options for fabric, including cotton and twill.\n\n\n## Wear a long coat casually\n\n1. Wear a black coat with ripped jeans and sneakers for a go-anywhere look. Long black coats are versatile because they can be casual or formal. Pair yours with ripped blue or black skinny jeans, a fitted graphic T-shirt, and your favorite sneakers. Plain white sneakers are a popular classic with this look, but you can experiment with vintage, black and white, or skate style sneakers to individualize the style.\n2. Pair baggy trousers with an oversized maxi coat and sunglasses for comfort. If you\u2019re looking to stay both comfortable and warm this winter, wear baggy black trousers rolled at the ankles with a cozy V-neck shirt under any color oversized maxi coat. Grey is a popular coat color for this look, but you can try navy or even a patterned coat. Sunglasses pull off the chic casual style of this look. Go with plain black glasses of any shape that you like. Try this look with either white sneakers or laced ankle boots.\n3. Wear a floor length coat with flared denim as an elegant-casual crossover. Floor-length coats take the classic long coat a few steps further; you can pull off a very cute, elegant casual look by pairing one with flared denim jeans. Wear this with an oversized knit sweater and dressy boots to complete the look. Add large sunglasses and a scarf to this look for extra flare.\n4. Try a long camel coat with a scarf for an intellectual touch. Long camel coats have an automatically sophisticated feel to them and are popular in the fall. Pair yours with black skinny jeans and a wide oversized scarf to look ready to hit the books. Complete this look with crisp white low-cut sneakers, a sweater, and pair of glasses.\n5. Add a beanie to any long coat for a fun casual look. Take the seriousness out of a long coat by adding a slouchy beanie on your head. Wear jeans or sweatpants, a long-sleeved T-shirt, and a pair of ankle boots or sneakers to finish off this casual style.\n6. Make an extra-long coat punk with colorful lace-up ankle boots. To achieve an 80s punk-inspired look, wear black skinny jeans and a button-down shirt with combat style boots under a mid-calf coat. To really finish off this look, add a few 1 inch (2.5 cm) band pins, or badges, to the lapels of your coat. Wear a pair of black sunglasses with this look to give it an extra rock-star vibe.\n7. Pair a pale maxi coat with cropped denim and a white T-shirt in the spring. Long coats aren\u2019t just for fall and winter; you can pair lighter long jackets with a variety of spring looks as well.

Instead of denim, wear a short spring sundress and casual sandals under your light long coat for cute but informal effect.\n\n\n## Dress up with a long coat\n\n1. Wear a long coat over black cigarette pants and heels for a sophisticated look. A long coat that\u2019s camel, grey, navy, red, or patterned looks great over top of black cigarette pants and heels.

Try a long faux-fur coat with strappy heels for an elegant edge. No need to spend lots of money on real fur \u2013 there are many nice faux fur options out there for coats.

Go with a plain button-down black coat over a dark colored dress in the winter, or pair a lightweight camel trench coat over a light-colored or floral dress in the summer. Add heels to match your dress and jewelry to be ready for any formal occasion.\n5. Wear a Paletot or Guards\u2019 coat for versatility.

{"input": "How to make a tube top?", "output": "Do you have some old shirts that you no longer wear? Why not turn them into a trendy tube top? If you don't have a t-shirt to spare, get some sewing elastic and stretchy fabric. With a little time and effort, you'll have a bunch of trendy tube tops to wear all summer long.\n\n## Use a shirt\n\n1. Find a t-shirt that that you don't mind cutting up, and turn it inside out. The shirt can be loose or fitted. If the shirt is loose, you will need to insert an elastic to help hold it up. If the shirt if brand new, make sure that its been washed and dried to remove any potential shrinking.\n2. Cut across the top of your shirt, just below the armpits. Try to cut through both layers of the shirt at the same time. This way, you will have to do less cutting. When you are done, discard the top part of the shirt, or save it for another project. If you are having troubles cutting straight, use a ruler or measuring tape as a guideline.\n3. Fold the cut edge down by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and secure it with sewing pins. Make sure that you are pinning all the way around the top of the shirt; you should still be able to open the shirt, like a tube. For a nice, crisp edge, press the folded hem down with a clothing iron.\n4. Sew along the folded edge, leaving a \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) gap in the back. Try to sew as close to the cut edge as you can. You will need the space between the stitching and the folded edge for the elastic. Also, make sure that you leave a \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) wide gap between where you started and finished sewing, or you won't be able to get the elastic inside. Try to use a thread color that closely matches your t-shirt. If your sewing machine has a knit fabric setting, try to use that; it usually looks like a standard straight stitch that's broken up by V shapes. Remove the pins when you are done. Also, remember to snip off the loose ends of the threads.\n5. Measure around your chest, just below the armpits, and cut some elastic according to that measurement. This will help hold your tube top up. Even if your shirt was fitted, an elastic might still be a good idea; fitted shirts can loosen over time.\n6. Clip a safety pin to one end of the elastic, and use it to guide the through the top hem of your shirt. Find the \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) wide gap in your stitching. Push the safety pin through it, and use it to guide the elastic all the way around the top of the shirt. When you reach the gap again, pull the safety pin out. Both ends of the elastic should now be sticking out of the gap. Be careful not to lose the other end of the elastic inside the shirt hem.\n7. Sew the two ends of the elastic together. Overlap the two ends by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters), then sew them down using the smallest stitch you can. Overlapping the ends of the elastic like this will prevent any unsightly bulges. When you are done, push the elastic back through the gap. Once you have the elastic back through the gap, you can sew the gap shut for a nicer finish.\n8. Wear your tube top. Be sure to wear a strapless bra with it so that you don't have any bra straps showing.\n\n\n## Make a tube top from scratch\n\n1. Measure around your bust and waist. Add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to each measurement. You will need this extra width for the seam allowances.\n2. Measure from just below your armpits down to your waist. Add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) to your measurement. You will need this extra length for the hems.\n3. Choose your fabric, and spread it out in front of you, wrong-side-up. The best fabric to use for a tube top is stretchy, jersey type fabric, like the kind used to make t-shirts.\n4. Draw a large rectangle according to your measurement. The top of the rectangle should equal your bust measurement. The bottom of the rectangle should equal your waist measurement. It will likely taper slightly.\n5. Fold the rectangle in half, lengthwise, with the right sides together. Secure the side edge with sewing pins. Leave the top and bottom edges alone for now. You will hem them later.\n6. Sew along the side edge using a \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance. Pull the pins out as you sew so that you don't accidentally prick yourself. When you are done, tie the threads off into tight knots, and snip them as close to the fabric as you can.\n7. Press the seam flat with an iron. Flatten the tube top on your ironing board, with the seam facing upward. Spread the seam allowances apart, so that they lay flat against the fabric to either side of the seam. Press them flat with a hot iron.\n8. Fold the top and bottom of your fabric down by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to make the hems. Secure the folds with sewing pins, and press them flat with a clothing iron. The wrong sides of the fabric should still be facing outward at this time.\n9. Sew the top and bottom hems, but leave a \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) wide gap on the top hem. You will need this gap to slide the elastic through. When sewing the hems, try to sew as close to the raw/cut edge as you can, so that you will have enough space for the elastic. When you are done, pull the sewing pins out. Be sure to tie the ends of the threads off into tight knots and to snip them off, as close to the fabric as you can. Try to use a stitch intended for sewing stretchy fabrics. It usually looks like a straight stitch, but is broken up by V-shapes.\n10. Measure your around chest, just below the armpits and cut a piece of elastic according to that measurement. This piece of elastic will help keep the tube top up, so make sure it is sturdy.\n11. Clip a safety pin to the elastic, and use it to feed the elastic through the top hem. Find that \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeter) wide gap in the top hem. Push the safety pin into the gap, then use it to feed the elastic through the hem. When you reach the gap again, unclip the safety pin. When you are done, you should have both ends of the elastic sticking out from the gap.\n12. Overlap the ends of the elastic be 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and sew them down. Use the smallest stitch you can, and be careful not to sew them to the fabric. When you are done, push the elastic back through the gap. At this point, you can sew the gap shut for a neater finish.\n13. Finished.\n"}
{"input": "The Episode IV-VI movies never mention the Emperor's name. In Episodes I-III, we can guess that Darth Sidious will be the emperor, but what about Chancellor Palpatine? If the audience didn't know that he was Sidious, the impact of the reveal would be far different than if they did.\nBut I did. In all the novels and comics that came out after \"Return of the Jedi\", the Emperor's name was stated plainly: Palpatine. \nSo when I saw the prologue movies, for the life of me I couldn't figure out: was I supposed to know that Palpatine was the villain?  \nMaybe the filmmakers figured that most of the moviegoing public never got into the Expanded Universe. But they had to know that the hardcore fans would know. Or maybe when you watched the movie, even if you hadn't heard of Palpatine, it was supposed to be obvious?\nWhat was the intent?", "output": "Palpatine's name was first given in the prologue to Alan Dean Foster's novelization of Star Wars (it was credited to Lucas, but he didn't write it), which came out in November 1976, six months before the May 25, 1977 release of the actual film.\nSo Palpatine being the Emperor was literally known before the public ever saw a Star Wars movie. It was, in fact, one of the very first things people could find out about the Star Wars universe.\nThe point of the films wasn't to conceal the fact Palpatine would end up the Emperor (or was Darth Sidious), it was to show that he was a masterful chessmaster who conned everyone, and that in large part it was the good guys responsible for his rise because of their own blindness. Amidala initiated the vote that removed his predecessor. Jar-Jar initiated the vote that gave him emergency powers. The Jedi Council allowed him to operate under their noses. Anakin never suspected he was being manipulated until too late, and so on. Just as the trilogy was meant as a tragedy showing Anakin Skywalker's rise and fall, it was an additional tragedy in that the person responsible for the whole mess was standing right there the entire time, in the case of the celebration at the end of The Phantom Menace quite literally."}
